# 🚀 Delivery Espacio - Space Shooter Game

**Delivery Espacio** is one of my first 2D game projects, developed using the **Godot Engine**.  
It is a fast-paced **space shooter** game designed not only to entertain but also to **educate players about the solar system**. 🌌🪐

This project was created while I was in lower secondary school (มัธยมต้น) and received the **Gold Medal** 🥇 from Thailand’s **Gold Medal – Lower Secondary Level, Software Project Category, National Student Arts and Crafts Competition**
